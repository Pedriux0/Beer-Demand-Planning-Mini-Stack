# Data (keep gitkeep if needed, but ignore actual data generally, though for this project we might want to check in sample data as per repo requirements "Create a high-signal Git commit history")
# The user wants "data/raw (messy CSV samples)" in the repo.
# So I will NOT ignore data/raw for now.
# But I might ignore large generated outputs if they were real, but user wants "outputs... committed or published".
# So I will actually keep most things, maybe strict ignore for temp files.
